:cpp: C++

= Wrapping up
Christos Chatzifountas  <christos.chatzifountas@yahoo.gr>

== A story of {cpp}
For the past 4 months I was trying - and by trying I mean straggling - to simultaneously learn {cpp}
and create a wrapper around https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwtgraph[gbwtgraph]t . Having only limited experience exposing api
from C, I assumed that it would have been a similar undertaking.
It turned out quite the opposite, it's a huge deal to export method functionality and/from {cpp}.
The resulting the https://github.com/pangenome/gbwt-wrapper[wrapper code] kept growing,
was of low quality and not worth investing any more time.
Maybe it was better to  rewrite the whole thing in a more modular way, in C or Rust.


== Enter SWIG
As I was ready to *defenestrate* a  significant amount of work hours, I stumbled upon
SWIG. SWIG stands for _Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator_. It abstracts
class methods in a similar way: It exposes classes and non-primitive return values  as "void*"
while the resulting function's name is prefixed by that of the class.
Unlike my version of a wrapper, it allows many other goodies, like the following:

image:{{site.url}}/assets/overloaded_functions.png[]

Pretty cool IMHO, function overloading with proper error messages.

Another cool aspect is the _typemaps_. SWIG uses nothing sort of a language FFI but
rather language specific C embedding (at least for Racket), so with a small section of code like the following

image::{{site.url}}/assets/scheme_handle_t_typemap.png[]

One can achieve seamless conversion between gbwtgraph types and types from the target language:

image::{{site.url}}/assets/nodes_to_handles.png[]

The output of *GRAPH-nodes-to-handles normally* is a byte array (char*)  that holds a  uint_64
and has a byte appended at the end to indicate orientation of traversal (left = 0, right =1), not very
user friendly. With the typemaps it is translated to a pair with either "+" or "-" and a
Racket integer. More visual, and *_handleable_* (pan intented).


== Building the SWIG based wrapper (Racket)


=== Basic requirements
All libraries required to build gbwtgraph, are also required to build the wrapper so first,
build the libraries as instructed in xref:{{site.url}}/assets/compile_gbwtwrapper.adoc[How to compile the library]

=== Prepare gbwtgraph
Next there is a peculiarity that swig has and must be dealt with. The swig preproccesor fails when
encountering "const static" and this is not a bug  (https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/241[see here ]).
So do an in place replace of "const static" with "static const" in gbwtgraph's directory :
[source, bash]
find ./ | xargs -I % perl -pi -e 's/static const/const static/g' %

Similarly do
[source, bash]
perl -pi -e 's/^\[\[deprecated/\/\/\[\[deprecated/' /usr/local/include/handlegraph/types.hpp

// find ./ | xargs -I % perl -pi -e 's/static const/const static/g' %

=== Racket gcc
The default Racket binary in most implementations is "Racket CZ". We want "Racket BC"  because
this is what swig uses. Also we want it to use the _cgc garbage collector_.
Following the documentation https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/master/racket/src/bc/README.txt[here],
grab the latest - at the time of writting - https://download.racket-lang.org/racket-8-2-src-builtpkgs-tgz.html[racket source code]
and after unziping run


[source, bash]
  ./configure --enable-bcdefault  --enable-cgcdefault --prefix={installation folder here}

Replacing {installation folder here} with your preference for installation location (I use ~/.local).



=== Compile swig
Finally grab the swig configuration file  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Gavlooth/f37bb312c5d163b1d889cdb6fd7b4df5/raw/c34d7c715d2cdb1ed804bf92acfc46fb9fc1d12f/gbwtgraph.i[gbwtgraph.i]
and run swig on it:
[source, bash]
swig -c++ -mzscheme -declaremodule  gbwtgraph.i;

Then use Racket's raco tool to  compile the resulting .cxx file with the appropriate flags
for CGC and {cpp} support, into an object file.

[source, bash]
raco ctool ++ccf  -fpermissive ++ccf -lstdc++  --cc --cgc  gbwtgraph_wrap.cxx ;

Assuming that /usr/local/lib is the location of the gbwtgraph dependencies
Compile the object files to a dynamic library.

[source, bash]
g++ -o gbwtgraph.so -Wl,--whole-archive \
                /usr/local/lib/libgbwtgraph.a \
                /usr/local/lib/libhandlegraph.a \
                /usr/local/lib/libsdsl.a \
                /usr/local/lib/libgbwt.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive -shared  ~/.local/lib/racket/mzdyn.o  gbwtgraph_wrap.o  -pthread -fopenmp

Make the necessary "Racket module directories" , so that you can run from the current folder the compiled racket module library,  gbwtgraph.so

[source, bash]
mkdir  -p $(racket -e '(string->symbol (path->string (build-path "compiled" "native" (system-library-subpath))))' | cut -c2-)

Move the dynamic library there.
[source, bash]
mv gbwtgraph.so  $(racket -e '(string->symbol (path->string (build-path "compiled" "native" (system-library-subpath))))' | cut -c2-)

Now you cant use gbwtgraph from within Racket  by doing

[source, racket]
(require "gbwtgraph")

The names for all the exported functions  functions are located in the scheme_reload function
in the gbwtgraph_wrap.cxx file generated from swig



 Next steps: Differential privacy

== Update
Instead of building it step by step  you use the   https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Gavlooth/0f5eba1124044a1220fdafd7c12c38c9/raw/4dbd945acc6147022fb2c68de4cb92ea48acc6e5/Dockerfile[Dockerfile]

==== Next step
Now that we managed to embed gbwtgraph in racket - with the potential of adding other languages,
we have the necessary tools to actually make a  *DSL for differential privacy on variation graphs*
