The [privvg](https://github.com/privvg) project builds tools to generate [differentially-private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) synthetic databases from graphical collections of sequence data known as *variation graphs*.
We document our work here, in a series of blog posts and notes, and [publish our code](https://github.com/privvg) under open source licenses for free use by all.
